1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

		The purpose of this Git Repository is hold my COMP 20 labs and projects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

		- My favorite assignment was Assignment 3. I I enjoyed setting up and 
		accessing the MongoDB server and also felt it brought everything else 
		in the course together. After completing Assignment 3, I finally 
		understood all the different pieces of Assignment 2 and felt like 
		I understood web programming enough to be able to build a full web 
		application. 
		
		- It also helped my final project group move forward with the 
		back-end/database part of our project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

		- When I began the course, I had previously used HTML and CSS but did 
		not know how the web works, JavaScript, how to use a server, how to 
		connect to a database, web security, etc. In addition to learning these 
		topics, I think I learned how to think about the web. Now when I look 
		at web pages, I can think about things like security and actually 
		understand what is happening.

		- I also learned how to work and compromise with other people during 
		the group project. In particular, we struggled to compromise on 
		functionality and our implementation priorities and had to learn to 
		work through that. I learned a lot about communication and dealing 
		with group members who don't participate as well during this project.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? 
Cite two examples as evidence.

		- I think the most important thing I learned during this project was how 
		to work on Computer Science projects with other people. Of course I also 
		learned web programming, but that is something I could have learned on 
		my own from the Internet, whereas it's difficult to create a long-term 
		project environment to practice working with other people. 

		- Before this course, I had never written code with another person. 
		During the semester group project, I've learned both how to write code 
		that is can easily be understood and modified by other people as well 
		as how to read other peoples' code and continue from where they left 
		off. A specific case of where this happened is one of my teammates 
		created the basic HTML, CSS, and JS files for several pages, but I needed 
		to add in a pop-up box with the instructions for our game. This involved 
		modifying existing JS code and add JS template scripts to the HTML file 
		without duplicating or overwriting the existing code. 

		- I've also learned quite a lot about communication during this group 
		project. Two of my group members are super communicative (and also close 
		friends) so planning times to meet with them and getting responses to 
		messages wasn't a problem. The two other members of my group are far less 
		communicative and we struggled to get them to attend meetings or respond 
		to our messages. One of the big things I took away from this is that 
		people have different communication styles and preferences. One of the 
		teammates who wouldn't attend meetings or respond to messages about meeting 
		up, but would respond almost immediately if we were talking about the actual 
		web application or code. Additionally, he always did he work consistently well 
		and on time, so I learned to step back and check in with him less. We really 
		were not able to get the other group member to be engaged so we learned it 
		was best to stop catering to him and constantly bugging him/asking for his 
		opinion and rather that it worked better to let him come to us and chime in 
		when he had something to contribute. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to 
delve deeper into?

		- While JavaScript is a frustrating and inconsistent language (that 
		caused me plenty of problems during the course), it seems to have a lot 
		of capabilities and I would like to explore that more. In particular, I 
		would like to explore interaction options and animations to make web 
		applications more engaging for the user (particularly with the speed and 
		shape of transitions between objects and web pages as the cursor moves, 
		scrolls, hovers, and clicks).
