COMP 20  
Lab 5  

This project provides the lyrics to Mariah Carey's "Emotion" as she tries to sing in the video. The changing lyrics were implemented using javascript.

I did not work with other students, but did use the Internet to understand some javascript functions and objects.

I spent an hour and a half on this lab.
