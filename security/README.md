This project contains an HTML page (and corresponding CSS) that outlines security vulnerabilities found in my partner's assignment 3 code. The HTML and CSS runs correctly and I found legitimate security vulnerabilities. 

I worked on this assignment for roughly 3 hours. I worked with Sophie Martin on this project.
