Assignment 2 - The Black Car Service  
March 9, 2017  

This project identifies cars and passengers (from a database) and places them on a map. While the program objectively works, I don't think I implemented the functions in the program as efficiently as I could have, because I struggled with the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. 

I did not work with anyone else on this project, however I did use the Internet and Stackoverflow as a resource to understand some of the APIs and to generally understand JavaScript. Additionally, I used the resources provided by Professor Ming Chow (and in particular, https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/google_maps/geolocation_map.html) as a starting point for the Google Maps API code. I also used a Stackoverflow post to understand how to implement multiple markers (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3059044/google-maps-js-api-v3-simple-multiple-marker-example).

I spent roughly 10 hours on this assignment.

The "passenger" and "my location" icons are from Icons8.
